# DataStructFrontend

Data Structure made easy, inspired by the book of Robert Lafore "data structures and algorithms in java".
Using C# as backend, and angular as frontend, I try to illustrate algorithms like the author did.

## Getting started

First time:

`npm i && npm start`

Second time:

`npm start`

## In progress

* Binary search
* Linear search

## RoadMap:

* Arrays
* Linked lists
* Tree structures

### Learning

From a learning perspective, this project allows one to visit/learn different aspects of angular2+ development: components communication, services, routing and manipulating data from a backend service.
